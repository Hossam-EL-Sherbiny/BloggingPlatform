# Simple Blogging Platform
This is a simple blogging platform where users can write and publish blog posts.
It provides features such as user authentication, comments, tags, search functionality, and sorting of blog posts based on categories, dates, or popularity.

I created this project to practice and apply what I have learned with myself. It allowed me to strengthen my skills in C#, .NET Core, and web development concepts.

## Features
- User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their blog posts.
- Blog Post Creation: Users can create new blog posts with a title, content, publication date, categories, and tags.
- Commenting System: Users can leave comments on blog posts to share their thoughts and engage in discussions.
- Tagging System: Blog posts can be tagged with keywords to improve searchability and categorization.
- Clean and SOLID Code: The codebase follows clean code principles and adheres to SOLID design principles for maintainability and extensibility.

## Technologies Used
- Language: C#
- Framework: .NET Core
- Database: In-memory data storage is used in the provided code sample.
- Libraries: No external libraries are used in the provided code sample.

## Getting Started
To run the blogging platform on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have the .NET Core SDK installed. You can download it from the official Microsoft website.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
3. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
4. Build the solution to restore the dependencies and compile the code.
5. Run the project, and the blogging platform will start on your local machine.

## Usage
Once the blogging platform is running, you can perform the following actions:

- Create a blog post: You can create a new blog post by providing the title, content, publication date, categories, and tags.

- Leave comments: You can leave comments on existing blog posts to share your thoughts and engage in discussions.

- Search for blog posts: Use the search functionality to find blog posts based on keywords, categories, or tags.

- Sort blog posts: You can sort blog posts by categories, dates, or popularity (number of comments).

## Future Enhancements
- Database Integration: Currently, the blogging platform uses in-memory data storage. For production use, integrating a database system such as SQL Server or MySQL would be beneficial for persistence and scalability.

- User Profile Management: Enhance the user experience by allowing users to manage their profile information, update passwords, and customize their account settings.

- Rich Text Editor: Implement a rich text editor to provide more formatting options for blog post content.

- User Roles and Permissions: Introduce role-based access control to manage user permissions and differentiate between administrators and regular users.
